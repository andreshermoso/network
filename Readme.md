## Professional Experience – Network Infrastructure Design & Deployment

In 2006, I was hired by Thales Nederland B.V. (Venezuela office) to lead the implementation of a Local Area Network (LAN) for a newly constructed two-story office building with 48 independent workspaces.

My responsibilities included:

Designing and proposing the complete physical and logical LAN layout, tailored to the building’s architectural specifications.

1. Preparing a comprehensive commercial proposal detailing:

     - Required human resources
     - Materials and equipment
     - Budget planning and cost estimates
     - Infrastructure sizing and scalability projections

2. Overseeing end-to-end procurement and logistics, ensuring timely acquisition and distribution of all networking materials.

3. Installing and configuring a Linux Debian-based Primary Domain Controller on an IBM System x3250 1U rack server.

4. Deploying an Asterisk VoIP PBX solution with support for 16 FXO ports, servicing approximately 100 VoIP audio/video phones.

In 2009, Thales Nederland B.V. signed a contract with my consulting firm, 3T Consultores C.A., to manage a LAN and __WAN__ __$${(i)}$$__ implementation project.

1. The LAN infrastructure followed a similar framework to the 2006 project, encompassing:

- Engineering design
- Business management coordination
- Technical deployment and oversight

2. The WAN deployment required collaboration with a telecommunications provider to enable secure data routing across multiple nationwide networks.

3. My company successfully managed the entire project lifecycle, from planning and vendor coordination to final delivery and system validation.
